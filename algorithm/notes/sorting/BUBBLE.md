# Sorting Algorithm: Bubble Sort

## Key Takeaways

- Divide into 2 loops
  - Round Loop
    - Each round must seek for the maximum/minimum value to be in the last index.
  - Pair Loop
    - In one round loop, compare each current and next index.
    - Compare a value of these two elements.
    - swap if the element is not sorted in the way you want.
